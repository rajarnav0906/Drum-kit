# Drum-kit
 This project deepened my grasp of JavaScript's DOM as I built a simple website (HTML, CSS, JS) for playing drum sounds. It honed my skills in essential DOM methods, enabling users to play sounds via mouse clicks on buttons or keyboard presses. The interactive design enhances user experience.
